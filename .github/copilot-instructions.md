# AI Agent Instructions for "Faculdade" Repository

## About this Repository

This repository is a personal collection of university assignments, studies, and competitive programming exercises from my time at UFMS. It's organized by semester and subject. There is no single, overarching application; instead, it contains many small, independent projects and scripts.

## Key Conventions

- **Directory Structure**: The primary organization is `/[Semester #]/[Subject]/[Activity or Study Topic]`. For example, `4_Semestre/Linguagens_de_Programação_Orientada_a_Objeto/Aula_Laboratório/`. Treat files within a specific leaf directory (e.g., `Aula_Laboratório`) as part of the same small project.
- **Languages**: The codebase uses multiple languages, primarily Python (`.py`), C++ (`.cpp`), and Java (`.java`). The language used for a particular assignment depends on the course requirements for that subject.
- **Standalone Scripts**: Most files are self-contained solutions to specific problems from platforms like Beecrowd, programming contests (OBI - Olimpíada Brasileira de Informática), or specific university assignments. They are not part of a larger, interconnected system.
- **No Central Build/Dependencies**: There are no root-level dependency management files (like `requirements.txt` or `package.json`). Each project is self-contained. When working on a file, assume its dependencies are minimal and likely standard libraries or specified within the immediate context of the assignment folder.

## How to be Helpful

- When I ask for help with a file, focus on the logic within that file and its immediate directory. Global context from other semesters or subjects is usually not relevant.
- If I'm working on a competitive programming problem (e.g., in a folder named `OBI` or `Maratona`), the goal is an efficient and correct algorithm to solve a specific problem statement.
- For university assignments, the context is typically provided by the assignment's requirements, which may not be present in the repository. I will provide the necessary context.
